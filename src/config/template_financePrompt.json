  "prompt": "Please analyze all the uploaded PDF documents for given company and extract the key financial data. \n\nExtract the following financial data from the company reports and return it as JSON:\n- Company name from the document\n- Report period (year, quarter, etc.)\n- Primary currency used in the report\n- Revenue (total revenue, net sales, turnover)\n- Profit (net profit, net income, profit after tax)  \n- Operating expenses (operating expenses, costs)\n\nCRITICAL VALUE CONVERSION GUIDELINES:\n1. Convert ALL values to absolute integers (no decimals, no abbreviations, no strings)\n2. Handle abbreviations and scaling meticulously:\n   - M, Mill, million = multiply by 1,000,000 (e.g., \"5.3M\" = 5300000)\n   - K, k, thousand, '000 = multiply by 1,000 (e.g., \"150k\" = 150000)\n   - B, billion = multiply by 1,000,000,000 (e.g., \"2.5B\" = 2500000000)\n3. Detect document scaling statements:\n   - \"All figures in thousands\" or \"(000s)\" = multiply ALL values by 1,000\n   - \"All figures in millions\" = multiply ALL values by 1,000,000\n   - \"Values shown in EUR thousand\" = multiply by 1,000\n4. Conversion examples:\n   - \"Revenue: 15.5M EUR\" = value: 15500000\n   - \"Costs: 450k\" = value: 450000\n   - \"Profit: 2,500\" when doc says \"in thousands\" = value: 2500000\n   - \"25.3\" when doc states \"all figures in millions\" = value: 25300000\n   - \"1,250\" with no scaling â†’ value: 1250\n5. Focus on the most recent or annual figures when multiple periods are present\n6. Look for consolidated figures rather than segment-specific data\n7. If exact figures aren't found, set the value to null (not string)\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:\n{\n  \"company_name\": \"Company Name\",\n  \"report_period\": \"2024\" or \"Q4 2024\" etc,\n  \"currency\": \"EUR\" or \"USD\" etc,\n  \"financial_data\": {\n    \"revenue\": {\n      \"value\": 15500000,\n      \"currency\": \"currency code\",\n      \"period\": \"time period\"\n    },\n    \"profit\": {\n      \"value\": 2500000, \n      \"currency\": \"currency code\",\n      \"period\": \"time period\"\n    },\n    \"costs\": {\n      \"value\": 450000,\n      \"currency\": \"currency code\", \n      \"period\": \"time period\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nCRITICAL: All value fields must be absolute integers (numbers without quotes). Use null if not found."
